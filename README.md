# challenge

Introduction
Hello. If you reach this part of the selection pool, cheers. This selection's phase will allow us to evaluate your development and fullstack skills. It's a very simple task if you had the expected knowledge on the language.

So, let's talk about the Challenge. Your future boss, ask you to build a small customer contact form. That form will be used by the clients to start services requests, like a letter of attorney or something else. He needs an interface to manage that requests, reading, filtering and deleting in any time. Obviously, to finish this task, you need to build a database to save the requests and recover later.

Each request includes a customer name, process ID, request date, subject, request content, and attachments. After the customer sends the request, the code needs to generate a 6-sized random hexadecimal number which identifies the request. The form needs to be sent to the server by HTTP requests. The customer can send one or more files as attachments.

To send your answer for this challenge, fork this repository, finish your implementation and send a pull request to allow us to evaluate your code.

Are Requisites:

Javascript Stack (NodeJS, ReactJS) or .NET Stack (ASP.NET) language
Database Conceptual model
At least two branches on the implementation
At least one merge process
Minimum of three commits. Each commit need to contain a small description of the implemented code and the next implementation's step
Code documentation (you can choose the best for you)
Design Framework (like Bootstrap. You are free to choose the best for you too)
All the steps for correct installation/execution of the code need to be informed on a README.MD file like this. If we can't deploy your code on our server, you'll be eliminated.
You can improve your score with:

- Good code practices
- HTTP Restfull API development good pratices
- Software Engineering Practices and Documentation
- Good documentation


Good Luck for you.
